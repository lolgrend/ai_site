The Forgotten Crusade of the Obsidian Dragons: A Historical Account from the Archives of Terra

In the twilight years of M41's first century, amid the countless conflicts that raged across the Imperium of Man, there occurred a remarkable campaign that has been largely overlooked by Imperial historians. The Obsidian Dragons, a lesser-known successor chapter of the Salamanders, embarked upon what would later be known as the Phoenician Crusade - a desperate attempt to contain a unique threat that emerged from the depths of the Ghoul Stars.

The initial incident occurred in 084.M41, when the mining world of Helios Tertius detected unusual energy signatures emanating from its northern polar region. The world's Mechanicus outpost recorded unprecedented geological disturbances that defied conventional analysis. Within solar weeks, the first signs of trouble manifested: crystalline structures began emerging from the planet's crust, each exhibiting properties that seemed to violate known laws of physics.

Chapter Master Varik Torch of the Obsidian Dragons recognized the pattern from ancient warnings preserved in their fortress-monastery's datacores. These crystalline formations bore an unsettling resemblance to theoretical models of "reality engines" - forbidden technology from the Dark Age of Technology that could locally alter the fundamental constants of space-time.

The Phoenician Crusade began in earnest when three full companies of the Obsidian Dragons deployed to Helios Tertius. They discovered a horror beyond initial expectations: the crystalline structures were actually autonomous machines, self-replicating through some unknown process that consumed both organic and inorganic matter. More disturbing still, they seemed to be building something - a vast, geometric megastructure that pulsed with otherworldly energies.

Captain Malakai Shen of the 2nd Company documented an especially notable encounter in his personal logs:

"The crystals sing. Not in any way that mortal ears can detect, but our auspex arrays pick up complex harmonic patterns in the electromagnetic spectrum. Brother-Librarian Daxus believes they're communicating, coordinating their growth and evolution. Every engagement requires new tactics - what worked an hour ago fails now, as if they're learning, adapting. The Emperor protects, but I fear we may need more than faith alone to prevail here."

The campaign lasted three standard years, marked by several distinctive phases:

1. The Containment Phase (084-085.M41)
- Establishment of quarantine zones around major crystal formations
- Development of specialized weapons and tactics
- First deployment of modified melta weapons with crystalline-resonance frequencies

2. The Investigation Phase (085-086.M41)
- Discovery of ancient human settlement beneath polar ice
- Recovery of partial STC fragments relating to "dimensional stabilization technology"
- First successful deactivation of smaller crystal clusters

3. The Purge Phase (086-087.M41)
- Implementation of "Operation Flamecleave"
- Deployment of modified cyclonic torpedoes
- Final assault on the central megastructure

Of particular interest to Imperial scholars was the unique approach taken by the Obsidian Dragons in combating this threat. Unlike many chapters who might have simply opted for overwhelming firepower, the Dragons demonstrated remarkable restraint and scientific methodology. They worked closely with Mechanicus representatives to understand the nature of their enemy, developing increasingly sophisticated countermeasures.

The chapter's Techmarines created specialized equipment for the campaign, including:

- The Resonance Hammer: A power maul modified to emit frequencies that could shatter the crystal structures
- Null-field generators: Devices that could temporarily suppress the reality-altering effects
- Modified Terminator armor with enhanced radiation shielding
- Crystalline detection auspex units

The campaign's conclusion came at a heavy cost. The final assault on the central megastructure required the sacrifice of an entire company of warriors, led by Captain Shen himself. They detonated a specially modified warp core at the heart of the structure, creating a localized reality implosion that destroyed the entire crystal network.

The aftermath of the Phoenician Crusade led to several significant developments:

1. The establishment of permanent monitoring stations throughout the sector
2. Creation of the Helios Protocols - standard procedures for dealing with similar technological threats
3. Addition of new training protocols to the chapter's combat doctrine
4. Formation of a specialized tech-hunter squad within the chapter

Today, the few remaining records of the Phoenician Crusade are preserved in the chapter's fortress-monastery on Obsidian Prime. The experience fundamentally changed the Obsidian Dragons, leading them to maintain a larger complement of Techmarines than is typical for most chapters. They continue to hunt for similar technological threats throughout their assigned sector, guided by the hard-won wisdom of their past experience.

A peculiar addendum to this account: every standard year, on the anniversary of the campaign's conclusion, the chapter's Librarians report disturbances in the Warp around Helios Tertius. Some believe this is merely an echo of the reality implosion that ended the crisis. Others, however, whisper that something of the crystal intelligence survived, waiting in some higher dimension for an opportunity to return.

Weapon Effectiveness Rankings:
1. Modified Melta weapons (High)
2. Plasma weapons (Moderate-High)
3. Thunder hammers with resonance modifications (Moderate)
4. Bolt weapons (Low-Moderate)
5. Las weapons (Low)

Tactical Considerations:
- Crystal entities demonstrate adaptive capabilities
- Standard Imperial tactics require modification
- Engagement distances must account for reality distortion effects
- Multiple simultaneous attack vectors prove most effective
- Electronic warfare systems experience increasing failure rates with prolonged exposure

Documented Crystal Formation Types:
- Alpha: Basic growth structures
- Beta: Defensive formations
- Gamma: Resource processing nodes
- Delta: Command/control nodes
- Epsilon: Reality distortion amplifiers
